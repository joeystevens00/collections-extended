# Mulset

## Why?

* Too many combinations of collection attributes to comprehend, code or maintain distinctly
	- unique
	- ordered
	- indexed
	- mutable
	- value restrictions (hashable -> fast contains check)
	- default values / generators / functions
* Collection functionality must be composed and the mechanics hidden behind the scenes ("collections for humans")
